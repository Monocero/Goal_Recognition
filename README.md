# Probabilistic Goal Recognition - Grid World

User controls an actor moving in a grid world, heading it toward one of the goal cells present in the grid. While moving, system estimates where actor is headed computing and updating a probability distribution over the set of goal cells.
## Dependencies 
- All code is written in Python 3.
- Third-party library **pygame** is used to construct the grid world.
- Third-party library **matplotlib**  is used to plot probabilities.
- Automated planner **Fast Downward** is used to compute probabilities.

It is assumed to use a Linux machine. 
### Installing Fast Downward
Install all Fast Downward's dependencies with
```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake g++ g++-multilib mercurial make python
```
Then download Fast Downward in *this* directory
```bash
hg clone http://hg.fast-downward.org downward
```

and build it 
```bash 
cd downward
 ./build.py
```
## Running the code 
Running the application with
```bash
python gridworld.py
```
you will see a 11x11 grid world appear and prompt you for specifying initial, goal and obstacle cells.
For convenience reasons, it is also possible to specify world dimensions. For example, 
```bash
python gridworld.py 10 20
```
will create a grid world with 10 rows and 20 columns. Only dimensions in range 5รท25 are accepted. If, for any reason, wrong command line arguments are passed, application handles it in a proper way.

## Costructing grid world
Running the application the following window will open. Select the initial cell clicking on it with the mouse

![init](./readme_images/start.png )

The selected cell will become green. After that application will prompt for a certain number of goal cells. When selected the number of cells desired press *enter* to continue (Note that in the previous step was not required to press *enter* being the start cell unique).

![goals](./readme_images/goals.png)

Select the obstacles cells in an analogous manner.
Actor can be moved around with the numeric keypad.
![goals2](./readme_images/goals_cont.png)

At this point grid world is constructed and actor will appear in the start position.

![obstacles](./readme_images/obstacles.png)

Actor can be moved around with the numeric keypad.

![move](./readme_images/move.png)

## Controls
Agent can move orizontally, vertically and diagonally. Use of numerical keypad is straightforward.

- 1: moves down and left.
- 2: moves down.
- 3: moves down and right. 
- 4: moves left.
- 6: moves right.
- 7: moves up and left.
- 8: moves up.
- 9: moves up and right.

If an action is not legal, it will be simply ignored.

## Probabilities 
Probabilities are printed in terminal while moving, as shown in the following screenshoot. Goals are ordered from bottom-up and (if in the same row) from left to right.

Each list, i.e., each probability distribution is also represented as bar graph and saved in *plots* folder. Folder is cleaned up at each run.
